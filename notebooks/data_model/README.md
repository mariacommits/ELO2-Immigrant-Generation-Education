# Data Analysis Results

The model is reveals highly significant factors driving the differences in educational attainment ($\text{Years\_of\_Schooling}$) between immigrant and native populations.

## Key Findings

### Quantifying the Attainment Deficits

This visualization highlights the specific losses in years of schooling associated with immigrant status and household language barriers.

**Interpretation:** The **Limited English Household Barrier** is more than double the magnitude of the residual Immigrant Gap, proving its importance as a policy focus.

### B. 💰 Mitigation Focus: Socioeconomic Impact

This section visually demonstrates the potential gain in educational attainment achievable through policies that increase household income.

![Prediction Line Plot showing that increasing POVPIP from 0 to 500 yields approximately 3.2 years of schooling gain](/figures/socioeconomic-impact.png)

**Interpretation:** This potential gain (3.2 years) is more than four times the size of the Dominant Language Barrier (0.74 years).
